## Added below 3 microservices

* Books API - Running on port 7100
* User UI - Running on port 7110
* Admin UI - Running on port 7120
* NoSql MongoDb - Running on port 27017

All these services are dockerised. User OpenId connect for authentication.
Have not used any message-broker as I have not used them, currently the project I'm working on using Scheduler services by RightScale to achive the same.
